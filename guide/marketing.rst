Marketing your event
====================

Good marketing is crucial to getting people to actually attend. Marketing takes on many forms:

* Your web site
* Email listserves
* Social media outlets
* Hardcopy materials
* Word of mouth

Your web site
-------------

Your conference web site is quite possibly to most important marketing tool you will have. Your site is the first place people will go to seek out information about your event, and they **will expect** to find what they are looking for there, so you better have it there for them!

Some existing Python conference web sites:

* `PyCon US`_ - the granddaddy of them all, runs on Symposion, and was built and is maintained by Eldarion, hosted on Gondor
* `PyTexas`_ - running a customized version of Symposion, maintained by members of the PyTexas group and hosted on Rackspace
* `PyOhio`_ - also running on Symposion and hosted on Gondor
* `PyData NYC`_ - running Symposion
* `PyData`_
* `PyCarolinas`_
* `PyCon Australia`_
* `PyCon Canada`_ - 2013 site running Symposion
* `pyArkansas`_ - running Symposion, hosted on Webfaction, maintained by the pyArkansas group
* `PyCon Taiwan`_
* `PyCon Germany`_

Email listserves
----------------

Announcements to email listserves is a great way to reach potential conference speakers and attendees. That said, if you join a list with the purpose of posting an announcement about your event, it is considered polite to first ask (the list admin if possible) if it's okay to post your announcement.
