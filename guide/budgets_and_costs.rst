Budgets and Costs
=================

Internet
--------

Terrestrial wireless is often a good choice, but can be difficult to locate
providers of.  Often you can find 100Mbps of bandwidth for $6,000 to
$12,000 for a week-long event.

Hotels, if they have appropriate bandwidth (probably multiple DS-3 or an
OC-3 line or better) will likely charge at least twice what a terrestrial
wireless is.

Access to Hotel wired infrastructure can cost hundreds per port, with
dozens of ports used for an event like PyCon.

WiFi service by the venue can cost as much as the Internet access.
