PyDay Caracas 2011
==================

PyDay Caracas 2011 was the first official conference 
ran by PyVE in Caracas -- Venezuela. It was on March 13,
2011 at the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University (UCAB) 
facilities.

The community was talking about organizing a conference,
we were discussing about running a PyCon, but this was
the first conference dedicated only to Python so we decided
to do something smaller and organize a PyDay.

When organizing a conference, a big or a small one, the first
thing we usually do is to select the time and space. We start
writing to several universities asking if they could host the
event, we normally have a couple of students or professors
to help in the process, then we select a reasonable day for
the event and start working based on that.

What we did:
------------

Once we had a day and a place for our PyDay,
we started looking for sponsors and speakers, 
this task was easy, we didn't need too much 
things because this was a small event and the
university wasn't going to charge us for the venue.

To find some speakers, I sent a thread to the mailing list
and a lot for members wanted to submit their presentations,
the submission was made by email because this was a small event
and the community in Caracas wasn't big enough to do it
on a larger scale (a website, for example).

Now, with the venue and the speakers, the only thing missing
was publicity, a member of the community is the owner of
a local Linux academy, so, he sponsored some posters to
paste them at the most important universities in Caracas.

For a one-day event, only a coffee-break is enough for
the attendance and just water for the speakers, we made
another sponsor pay for a couple big coffee bottle, some 
cookies and a lot of water for the speakers and for the
members who were helping the day of the event.

Lessons learned:
----------------

1. There is no need to open a bank account to
   receive sponsorship and run a conference.
2. There is no need to have a legal figure
   to receive sponsorship.
3. Small events are the best way to start making
   some noise with your local Python community
4. Students are a very loyal and receptive public,
   they are usually happy with this kind of events
   at their universities.
5. You **must** have a person dedicated to monitor the time
   per presentation, speakers almost always take longer
   than they say (at least in Venezuela)
6. Sometimes the time for questions after the presentation
   is not enough, try to reserve your venue for at least
   an extra hour after the event finishes. For example, 
   if the event is supposed to end at 16:00, you should reserve
   it until 17:00.
7. Try to have at least one hour before the conference starts
   to put all the venue in order, connect and place your
   Video Beam in the best place, make sure the microphones
   works well and that the audio from the computer is setted in a proper
   volume.
8. To run a PyDay, a one-man organizing team is fine, but if you can get
   some help from other members of your local community is better. PyDay Caracas
   was organized and coordinated by just one person.
