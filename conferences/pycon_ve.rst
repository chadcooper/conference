PyConVE 2012
============

Here i will put down some of my experience
as the head organizer of the PyCon in my
country. Also expose some of the lessons
learned in the process.

Conferences in Venezuela, some context first:
---------------------------------------------

In Venezuela, we've done several big 
conferences and install fests.
For example, the Inter-University
Computer Science Conference, and the
Latin American Free Software Install Fest.
But, we've done only just a couple of PyDays
y two different cities and some isolated Python
small conferences and developers meeting.

The Venezuelan community tries to do at least
one PyMeeting monthly, sometimes we can, sometimes
we can't, but we're almost always in touch through
the mailing list, that was the way we did everything
for the PyConVE 2012.

Why a PyCon anyway?, the beginning
----------------------------------

On 2011 we did a PyDay and it was great, we has a really
good time and I had a great time while organizing and running
it. By the end of the year another member and I came up
with this crazy idea in the mailing list and some other
members told us that it wasn't going to work, but we did it
anyway, we thought that was the only way the whole community
finally met and start doing something bigger.

Also, we wanted to measure how big the community is
or how big it would become, how many people would be or
is interested in programming in Python.

So, we decided we'll do it around November 2011 and we started
planning on December 2011. I wrote Wesley Chun to ask him if
he would like to come down and speak at our event, he couldn't
make it, but he gave me a lot of contacts who would surely be
interested and some of them were in South America. By the beginning
of January 2013, I had 2 confirmed international speakers: 
Facundo Batista (Argentina) and Érico Andrei (Brazil) and 
another one to be confirmed: José Montes de Oca, from Google, thanks
to Wesley.

I promised Facundo and Érico that we were going to cover
their flight tickets and hotel, but we didn't had any 
sponsor at that moment.

Then I wrote to my University to ask if they could
host the event for free, the answer was a solid **yes**
so I reserved two labs and one auditorium for the three
days of the event: November 1, 2 and 3rd.

Now, we had international speakers and a place to 
run the PyCon, but no sponsors and no national speakers.

In the Middle
-------------

Well, we were on March 2013, I saw the Argentinians
launched the website for their PyCon, we didn't have
anything, not even an *Under Construction* page and I
had a Panic Attack. I rushed to find a sponsor to develop
the website, I asked the company where I was working and
we did a great job using django and twitter bootstrap, 
now, we had a decent website and a place where people could
register to attend and place presentation proposals.

My co-organizer, Francisco Palm, made me see that we weren't
as bad as I thought, he found some sponsors to cover posters
for the event and lunch for the speakers and organizers, we had
a place, a website, international speakers and some national
speakers already registered in the website, so, I felt better.

Now, the real deal was finding a sponsor for the flying tickets
and the Hotel for the international speakers. Érico accepted staying
at my place and Facundo was coming with his family, so I needed
to find a bigger room. I wrote a couple of emails to several companies
that work with Python based technologies and I finally got them to pay
for the tickets and the Hotel for Facundo & family.

In the meantime, José confirmed, but it was too close to the 
event date and the tickets were too expensive, so we arranged
to do his presentation via Google HangOuts.

It was about two days before the event when I finally had
everything done and finally slept well.

The actual event
----------------

The first day, I got in a traffic jam with the speaker
who was supposed to open the event, so it was supposed to start
at 8:00, and it actually started at 9:30, pretty cool for the first day.

The other two days went OK, just a couple of issues with uninstalled
software at the labs, but nothing critical, I got a lot of help
from the community those days, they were in everything, if I was
tired or left to sleep at *some place at the university*, someone 
got in charge of everything and solved things as good as he could.

Conclusion and lessons learned
------------------------------

In the end, we got only nice comments and a very
good feedback for the event.

Some lessons we (or I) learned from the PyCon:

1. There is no need to have a bank account and a legal
   figure to get sponsors, although for this kind of events
   it is a nice plus, we lost some sponsors for not having this.
2. If nobody wants to help at first, don't let it keep you from
   doing things. People is more likely to join if things are moving
   rather than starting from scratch.
3. There are things that you can't control, like traffic jams and 
   internal politics or bureaucracy at the university that hosts the event.
   You have to know it and accept it, that's the only way to relax if
   something happens. 
4. You can have a Plan B if something happens, but you can't foresee
   everything, remember that you're human.
5. Don't accept all your friend's presentations at first, save some
   because always a couple of speakers will cancel late. 
   you can't foresee everything.

The best thing about the PyConVE, wasn't the event itself, was the
wave it left, now there is people in other states organizing PyDays
and doing PyMeetings and promoting Python in their universities, it was
a huge step for the Venezuelan Python Community.
