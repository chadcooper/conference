pyArkansas
===========

pyArkansas was started by Chad Cooper and Greg Lindstrom in the summer of 2008. We tried to start up a user group in Arkansas, but honestly we never got it off of the ground, as most folks that we interested lived in different parts of Arkansas, separated by hours of driving. Greg conceived the idea of pyArkansas, and Chad jumped on board to help.

The inagural pyArkansas was pretty low-key; Jeff Rush from the Texas Python group was kind enough to set us up with a wiki that they were using to run PyTexas on. Greg contacted the Computer Science Department at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway about them participating and possibly hosting our event. They immediately and very graciously offered to host our event, provide wireless internet access, and even provide laptops and teach two Introduction to Python courses.
