pyArkansas
===========

pyArkansas was started by Greg Lindstrom and Chad Cooper in the summer of 2008. Greg conceived the idea of pyArkansas, and Chad jumped on board to help.

2008
-----

The inagural pyArkansas of 2008 (October 4th) was pretty low-key; Jeff Rush from the Texas Python group was kind enough to set us up with a wiki that they were using to run PyTexas on. Greg contacted the Computer Science Department at the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) in Conway about them participating and possibly hosting our event. They immediately responded and very graciously offered to host our event, provide wireless internet access, and even provide laptops and teach two Introduction to Python courses. UCA has been behind us and supported us ever since then.

With the help of O'Reilly Publishing, we were able to bring in Noah Gift as a speaker. Noah drove from Atlanta right after a major hurricane and gas was pretty hard to find in areas of the southeast. Jeff Rush and several others came from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area as well. We had about 55-60 attendees total that day. Everyone had a great time and we received positive feedback from the event:
