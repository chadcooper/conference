pyArkansas
===========

pyArkansas was started by Greg Lindstrom and Chad Cooper in the summer of 2008. Greg conceived the idea of pyArkansas, and Chad jumped on board to help. The following is an attempt to provide a history of sorts for pyArkansas and comes from a combination of emails, documents, and a dump of Chad Cooper's brain (scary).

2008
-----

The inagural pyArkansas of 2008 (October 4th) was pretty low-key; Jeff Rush from the Texas Python group was kind enough to set us up with a wiki that they were using to run PyTexas on. Greg contacted the Computer Science Department at the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) in Conway about them participating and possibly hosting our event. They immediately responded and very graciously offered to host our event, provide wireless internet access, and even provide laptops and teach two Introduction to Python courses. UCA has been behind us and supported us ever since then.

With the help of O'Reilly Publishing, we were able to bring in Noah Gift as a speaker. Noah drove from Atlanta right after a major hurricane and gas was pretty hard to find in areas of the southeast. Jeff Rush and several others came from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area as well. We had about 55-60 attendees total that day. Everyone had a great time and we received positive feedback from the event:

2012
----

2012 was a true banner year for pyArkansas. Attendance jumped to over 100, with approximately 110 people in attendance. pyArkansas 2012 was on October 27th. After the 2011 conference, we decided we needed a larger venue that had a room that could fit over 100 people in; this would allow us to have opening and closing sessions along with a keynote. We chose Brewer-Hegeman Conference Center on the campus of UCA, and it worked out great. We raised more funds than ever before from more sponsors than ever before, which allowed us to (finally) have a t-shirt, rent the Brewer-Hegeman Conference Center, and provide our attendees with afternoon beverages. We intended to have all tutorials and talks video recorded, but the arrangements for that literally fell through the week before the conference.
