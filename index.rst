.. From Python Import Conference documentation master file

Welcome to From Python Import Conference
========================================

This guide / book is a community driven guide built from the collective
knowledge of conference volunteers and organizers from around the world.

The hope is to provide to you, a budding conference organizer enough information
with which to build your community event and put on an amazing event that is
not only self gratifying, but enriches the entire community it is geared around.

Much of the information in this guide will be based off the collective
experience of primarily Python Community oriented conferences, such as PyCon US,
EuroPython, Python Canada, and many others; however, much of this information is
just as relevant and important to anyone looking to put together a community
event.

We hope that if you are an organizer or volunteer that you take a look at
the `GitHub repository`_ and consider contributing. Without your knowledge and
contributions, this guide will be incomplete.
